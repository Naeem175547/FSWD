Relative Positioning:

Relative positioning refers to positioning elements relative to their normal position in the document flow.
 In this method, elements are moved from their default position based on their relationships with other elements.



Absolute Positioning:

Absolute positioning involves placing an element at a specific location on the page, usually based on
 coordinates (top, left, right, bottom) relative to its nearest positioned ancestor 
 (an ancestor element that has a non-static position, such as relative, absolute, or fixed).
