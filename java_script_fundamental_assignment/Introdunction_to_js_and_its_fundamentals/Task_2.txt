JavaScript and HTML serve different purposes in web development:

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language):

Purpose: HTML is a markup language used for structuring the content of a webpage. It defines the elements 
and their layout on a page.
Example Use: Creating the basic structure of a webpage, including headings, paragraphs, lists, images, and links.
html code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My Webpage</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
    <img src="image.jpg" alt="An example image">
    <a href="https://example.com">Visit Example.com</a>
</body>
</html>
JavaScript:

Purpose: JavaScript is a scripting language that adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. It is
 used to manipulate the content and respond to user actions.
Example Use: Validating user input in a form, creating interactive sliders, updating content without reloading 
the page, and handling events.
html code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>JavaScript Example</title>
    <script>
        function greet() {
            alert('Hello, World!');
        }
    </script>
</head>
<body>
    <h1 onclick="greet()">Click me</h1>
</body>
</html>
In summary, HTML provides the structure and static content of a webpage, while JavaScript adds interactivity
and dynamic features, enhancing the user experience. Both are often used together to create modern, responsive
 web applications.
