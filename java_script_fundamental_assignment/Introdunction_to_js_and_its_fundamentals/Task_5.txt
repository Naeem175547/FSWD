Comments in JavaScript are essential for improving code readability and providing additional information to developers who read or maintain the code. 
They don't affect the execution of the program but serve as documentation for understanding the code's purpose, logic, or any relevant details. Comments can
 also be helpful when collaborating with other developers.

Here are examples of single-line and multi-line comments in JavaScript:

Single-Line Comments:
Single-line comments are used for short annotations on a single line.
javascript code
// This is a single-line comment
let x = 5; // Initializing a variable
Multi-Line Comments:
Multi-line comments are used for longer explanations or comments that span multiple lines.
javascript code
/*
  This is a multi-line comment
  It can be used to provide more detailed explanations
  or to comment out multiple lines of code.
*/
let y = 10; // Another variable
It's good practice to use comments to explain complex sections of code, provide information about the purpose of functions or variables, and include any 
other details that can aid in understanding the codebase. However, it's also important to maintain clean and self-explanatory code, so comments should be used 
judiciously, and the code itself should be as clear as possible.
