
In JavaScript, variables are used to store and manage data. Declaring variables allows you to reserve a
 named memory location to store values, making it easier to reference and manipulate those values in your code.

The let keyword is used to declare variables in JavaScript. Here's how you declare a variable using let:

javascript code
let variableName;
In this example:

let: This keyword indicates the start of the variable declaration.
variableName: You replace this with the name you want to give to your variable.
