
1 Unary Operators:

Operate on a single operand.
Example: ++ (increment), -- (decrement), ! (logical NOT), typeof (returns a string indicating the type of an operand).
javascript code
let x = 5;
x++;      // Increment x by 1
console.log(x);  // Output: 6

let y = true;
console.log(!y);  // Output: false

let z = "Hello";
console.log(typeof z);  // Output: "string"
2 Binary Operators:

Operate on two operands.
Examples: + (addition), - (subtraction), * (multiplication), / (division), === (strict equality), !== (strict inequality).
javascript code
let a = 10;
let b = 5;
let sum = a + b;    // Addition
console.log(sum);   // Output: 15

let c = "Hello";
let d = "World";
let concatStr = c + " " + d;  // String concatenation
console.log(concatStr);       // Output: "Hello World"

let isEqual = a === b;  // Strict equality check
console.log(isEqual);   // Output: false
2 Ternary (Conditional) Operator:

Takes three operands and is a concise way to write an if-else statement.
Example: condition ? expr1 : expr2 (returns expr1 if condition is true, and expr2 otherwise).
javascript code
let age = 20;
let status = (age >= 18) ? "Adult" : "Minor";
console.log(status);  // Output: "Adult"
In summary, unary operators work on one operand, binary operators work on two operands, and the ternary operator works on three operands to provide a compact way of 
expressing conditional logic.
