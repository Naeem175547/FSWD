
Operators in JavaScript can be categorized based on their functionality into:

Arithmetic Operators:

Examples: + (addition), - (subtraction), * (multiplication), / (division), % (modulo).
Comparison Operators:

Examples: == (equality), === (strict equality), != (inequality), !== (strict inequality), < (less than), > (greater than).

Logical Operators:

Examples: && (logical AND), || (logical OR), ! (logical NOT).
Assignment Operators:

Examples: = (assignment), += (addition assignment), -= (subtraction assignment), *=(multiplication assignment),
/=` (division assignment).
Unary Operators:

Examples: ++ (increment), -- (decrement), typeof (returns a string indicating the type of an operand).
Ternary (Conditional) Operator:

Example: condition ? expr1 : expr2 (returns expr1 if condition is true, and expr2 otherwise).
These operators enable developers to perform a wide range of operations, from basic arithmetic calculations to complex
 logical evaluations and assignments, contributing to the versatility and expressiveness of JavaScript code.
