Operator Precedence in JavaScript determines the order in which operators are evaluated in an expression. Operators with higher precedence are evaluated first. 
For example, in the expression a + b * c, multiplication (*) has higher precedence than addition (+), so b * c is evaluated first.

Operator Associativity comes into play when there are operators with the same precedence. It defines the order in which operations are performed. For example,
 if you have two operators with left associativity, they are evaluated from left to right.

Understanding these concepts is crucial for writing code that behaves as expected. It helps in avoiding errors and ensures that expressions are evaluated in
 the intended order. For example:

javascript code
let result = 5 + 10 * 2;
console.log(result);  // Output: 25 (because multiplication has higher precedence)

let x = y = 10;
console.log(x);  // Output: 10 (assignment has right-to-left associativity)
console.log(y);  // Output: 10
Explicitly using parentheses can also be important to override the default precedence or associativity:

javascript code
let result = (5 + 10) * 2;  // Use parentheses to enforce addition before multiplication
console.log(result);        // Output: 30
In summary, understanding operator precedence and associativity is vital for writing code that accurately reflects the desired logic and for avoiding unexpected 
behavior in expressions. It allows developers to control the order of evaluation and enhance the clarity and predictability of their code.
