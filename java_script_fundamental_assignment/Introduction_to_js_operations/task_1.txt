
Operators in JavaScript are symbols that perform operations on variables or values. They are essential in programming because they enable the manipulation and 
computation of data. Operators can be used for arithmetic operations (e.g., +, -, *, /), comparison (e.g., ==, ===, <, >), logical operations (e.g., &&, ||), 
assignment (e.g., =), and more. They provide a way to perform actions like addition, subtraction, comparison, and logical evaluations, allowing developers to create 
complex algorithms and make decisions within their code. In essence, operators play a crucial role in expressing computations and relationships between values, 
making them fundamental to programming languages like JavaScript.
